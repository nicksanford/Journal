As a web developer for a 3D printing information repository / ecommerce website,
I am constantly reminded of the exciting applications that 3D printing technology
promises, but has yet to deliver. One of the technology's most exciting potential
applications, and one of its strongest advantages over traditional manufacturing
technologies, is the ability to **create products which are customized exactly to
end-user tastes and needs**.

A major limitation at the moment to making this vision accessible to non-technical
users is how **difficult and complicated it is to modify 3d models**.
Generally, model files such as [STLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format%29)
have to be customized by hand in 3d modeling suites such
as [Blender](http://www.blender.org/).  Although many functional 3d printable
models already exist in active ecosystems such as [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/),
one must have a certain degree of skill with complex modeling software to customize
them to fit one's specific needs.

This means that the number one advantage
of 3d printing: enabling people to print customized items that meet their exact needs,
**is currently unattainable without 3d modeling skills**. Without such skills, or the
money to hire a modeler, one's only option is to use the models already available
in the ecosystem, which are approximations at best to one's unique needs.
In short, the **3d printing ecosystem lacks a way to create customized 3d
models in a way that is simple, cheap, and user-friendly**.

In the next few days and weeks I will explore ways to simplify the 3d model
customization process by building simple **webapps that allow users to generate
fully customized 3d models** to their exact specifications from as few inputs as possible.
