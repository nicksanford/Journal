I began intensively studying computer science and
programing in May of 2013 after completing my honors thesis for my major in
Asian Studies Language and Literature from University of Texas at Austin.
I wanted to switch from a foreign language / liberal
arts focus to something completely new and challenging.

I started by doing Zed Shaw's awesome
[Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org) course in an effort to learn some
basic programming skills. At the time I intended to use python in an Economics
Masters program I was planning on applying to, but it became clear to me
early in the course that I was much more interested in programing and software development
than applying these skills to economics exclusively. From that time on, I was
hooked on software.

I decided to move to Beijing and work part-time as a freelance translator while
devoting the vast majority of my time to study programing and computer science.
I picked projects every week to learn new skills and very quickly after
completing LPTHW I got a job at thre3d.com where a [friend](#) of mine was
working at the time.  They needed a developer to design and build tools for
their social media campaign on reddit and twitter and at the time the two developers
they had were swamped with other work.

They required project be implemented in Rails (despite the fact no-one on
the team knew Rails) so I spent the next month getting comfortable with Ruby and
Rails. Within about a month and a half I learned enough Ruby and Rails to
implemented a solution that met their requirements. After completing the project
they hired me on as a full time web developer.

In the time since then I have expanded their social media war-chest, researched and
helped implement their eCommerce sales platform, and built data visualization tools
for their massive 3d printing technology database. The job has given me valuable experience
in the software industry and more than anything else taught me how to learn the
skills I need to know to implement whatever the job requires.

Throughout this entire process, I have been 100% self-taught.  I have followed
the amazing tutorials by [Schneems](http://www.schneems.com/ut-rails/) who teaches
Rails at my university, [Michael Hartl](http://www.railstutorial.org/book), and
am currently reading Russ Olsen's [Eloquent Ruby](http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=-s2xL0pVsLUC&source=gbs_slider_cls_metadata_7_mylibrary&redir_esc=y).

Recently I have been interested in taking an algorithms and data-structures
course. After discovering that most of these courses are taught understandably
in either C, C++, or Java, I decided to first learn C in order to get the most
out of the course.  I just started taking Zed Shaw's [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

When I get the time, I also have Haskell high on my "things I want to study" list.
At the moment however I am focused on learning more about Ruby, Rails, Python,
Flask, Sinatra, Javascript, algorithms / data-structures, and C.
