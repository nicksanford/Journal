My name is Nick Sanford. I love building service oriented, easily testable, web
applications / APIs that stick to the UNIX philosophy of doing one job and doing
it well.

I love learning about Functional Programming and building stuff in Haskell.
I try to integrate the dicipline and abstractions I have learned from ML-style FP in my
OO Ruby, Python, and JavaScript code to produce composable, dependable, and modular
software.

I have built both monolythinc Rails apps as well service oriented Sinatra, Flask,
vanilla Python, and Node.js cloud applications. Checkout my [projects](/projects)
and and see what I have done!

I recently moved to NYC from Austin after living and working as a developer in Beijing for a year
and am actively looking for employment at a NYC based software company in search of an
energetic engineer who is eager to learn new development methods / technologies and commited
to code quality.

If you think I would make a strong addition to your team feel free to checkout my
[resume](/resume/NickSanfordsResume.docx) and drop me an [email](mailto:nicholascsanford@gmail.com).

I began intensively studying computer science and
programing in May of 2013 after completing my honors thesis for my major in
Asian Studies Language and Literature from University of Texas at Austin.
I wanted to switch from a foreign language / liberal
arts focus to something completely new and challenging.

I started by doing Zed Shaw's awesome
[Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.org) course in an effort to learn some
basic programming skills. At the time I intended to use python in an Economics
Masters program I was planning on applying to, but it became clear to me
early in the course that I was much more interested in programing and software development
than applying these skills to economics exclusively. From that time on, I was
hooked on software.

I decided to move to Beijing and work part-time as a freelance translator while
devoting the vast majority of my time to study programing and computer science.
I picked projects every week to learn new skills and very quickly after
completing LPTHW I got a job at thre3d.com where a [friend](#) of mine was
working at the time.  They needed a developer to design and build tools for
their social media campaign on reddit and twitter and at the time the two developers
they had were swamped with other work.

They required project be implemented in Rails (despite the fact no-one on
the team knew Rails) so I spent the next month getting comfortable with Ruby and
Rails. Within about a month and a half I learned enough Ruby and Rails to
implemented a solution that met their requirements. After completing the project
they hired me on as a full time web developer.

In the time since then I have expanded their social media war-chest, researched and
helped implement their eCommerce sales platform, and built data visualization tools
for their massive 3d printing technology database. The job has given me valuable experience
in the software industry and more than anything else taught me how to learn the
skills I need to know to implement whatever the job requires.
